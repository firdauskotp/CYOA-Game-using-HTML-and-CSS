            have travelled over the continent in hiding. You are a loyal knight to 
            the late Prince Quan, father of Prince Leif. Your lord have been killed
            by the dragon rider King Travant of Southern Thracia, your lord have been 
            killed in a coup initiated by Lord Raydrick of Conote.  While running, you find yourself
            in safe hands thanks to the Fiana Brigade led by Eyvel. They alongside the 
            citizens of Fiana have protected you, your daughter and Prince Leif. However it is time for a change.
