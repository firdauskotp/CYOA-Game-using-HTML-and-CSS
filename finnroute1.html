            You saw your two comrades, Mareeta and Nanna, being taken away by Raydrick.
            He have placed many soldiers in the area and plans to destroy Fiana.
            Prince Leif wants to save the villagers but you are in a dilemma.
            Will you accompany him and your brigade to <font color='red'><a href='finnroute2.html'>save the people who 
            have taken care of you</a></font> or would you <a href='Finnbadend1.html'>charge Raydrick to save your comrade and daughter?</a>
