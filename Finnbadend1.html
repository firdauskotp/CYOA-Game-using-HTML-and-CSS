            You charged towards the enemy frontlines, leaving Prince Leif and the rest of
            the mercenary company to deal with the attack on the villagers. Unknown to you,
            you found out that Raydrick is unable to be injured by your Brave Lance.
            A cloaked figure teleported away with Mareeta and Nanna as you are on the ground bleeding,
            thanks to Raydrick stabbing you with his sword while being outnumbered with his forces.
            Prince Leif lost his best friend and advisor, was fueled with hatred. He strayed from his path
            and eventually met his end trying to engage Raydrick's forces.
