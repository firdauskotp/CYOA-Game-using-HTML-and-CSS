            You made the wise choice of saving the villagers. Raydrick's army have no choice but to retreat.
            The villagers express their gratitude and apologies as they feel it was their fault Raydrick escaped with the hostages.
            You explained how indebted you are to the villagers and even now, the debt is still not paid. The villagers talked about how
            you should seek help from Hannibal, the Shield of Thracia. Your brigade agrees and heads out. However Raydrick have other plans.
            Along your way to meet Hannibal, you were ambushed and Prince Leif was taken captive. You now have to think of rescuing the 
            young prince or pursuing Hannibal. Your brigade is split between the two choices, some believing that saving Prince Leif is essential
            to your quest of freeing Thracia and how finding Hannibal will indirectly rescue the prince. As the prince's close
            friend and guardian, do you <a href="finnroute3A.html" id="choicelink">rescue Prince Leif</a> or <a href="finnroute3B.html" id="choicelink">find Hannibal</a>?
